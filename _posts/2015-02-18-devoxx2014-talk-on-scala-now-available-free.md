My talk at DevoxxUK 2014 has now been made freely available[\*](#footnote) at parleys.com. So if you would like to me reprise my [previous post](http://grundlefleck.github.io/2013/06/23/using-scala-will-make-you-less-productive.html) in full audiovisual form, go [here](https://www.parleys.com/talk/how-switching-to-scala-made-me-less-productive-and-why-that-matters-less-than-i-thought).

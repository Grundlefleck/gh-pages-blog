If you're like me, at some point you have wanted to join a project. Perhaps you wanted to improve your skills, try a different technology, or brighten up your CV. But alas, you didn't know the best way to get started.

I am trying to provide that exact opportunity, in conjunction with RecWorks' ("Meet-A-Project" scheme)[http://londonjavacommunity.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/new-ljc-event-london-java-community-meet-a-project-on-weds-20th-mar-at-1830-ljcjug-organised-by-recworks/]. I have an open source project, called (Mutability Detector)[http://mutabilitydetector.org], with issues and features waiting to be completed, specifically earmarked for newcomers to the project. I promise a helpful, friendly environment, in which to dip your toe in open (source) waters.

If you want to know more details, head over to the project blog, for a (description on the how and why of getting involved)[http://mutability-detector.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/meet-project-opportunity-to-join-open.html].
